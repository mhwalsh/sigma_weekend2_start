# Running the Server

This Challenge will require you to setup and run the application in this repository.

[Refer to the jQuery AJAX lecture notes for installing and running the server]  (https://github.com/kdszafranski/prime-ajax-intro)

These instructions will be the same for all of our node applications.

### Steps
- explore the file structure I was give
- get some data on the dom, ensure I understand the data structure I am working with.
- pull display out into a function to display one student
- cycle through the students
	- incrementing with ++ and --
	- fix these to cycle to the end/beginning of the array
	- test and ensure that never less than one or greater than the end of my array.
- index tracker
	- get tracker on the dom
	- style the lis with css
	- update tracker after button is clicked
- timer - setInterval and clearInterval
	- look at docs
	- refactor out the next and prev so I can call them from multiple places.
- add fade in and fade out
